    <h2>Sofware</h2>
    <p>
      I beleive that sofware is becoming increasingly important in science, and that developing software, or other methods,
      is paramount.
      I also think scientific software ought to be open-source in order to allows reproducible and transparent reaseach.
      This sort of ideas is explained much more convincingly <a href="todo">here</a> and <a href="todo">there</a>.
      Here is a list of my modest contribution to scientific software, which I hope to grow a bit :).
