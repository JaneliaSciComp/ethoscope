Ethoscope
============

Organisation of the code:

* `src` contains the main python package named `ethoscope`. It is installed on video monitors (devices), but it can be used as a standalone off line tracking tool.
* `node-src` contains the software stack runing on the 'node'. Node is a unique computer that syncs and controls devices.
* `prototypes` contains (often unsucessful) developmental trials.
* `scripts` contains a toolbox of scripts mainly to install the software on target devices.
