This website is a github page. It means you can go on the `gh-page` branch and modify its content.
To make a new post, you can simply generate a new file in the [posts](https://github.com/gilestrolab/ethoscope/tree/gh-pages/_posts) directory.

If you are not a registered collaborator, you can send a pull request.

This website is generated with [jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com), so you can write post in markdown syntax with optional syntax highlighting.

For instance, 

```python
import ethoscope
print "hello world"
for i in [1,2,3]:
    print i
```
