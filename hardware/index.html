    <h2>Ethoscope Hardware</h2>
    <p>
      This page explains what type of hardware is needed to set-up a minimal working platform.

		  A FIGURE HERE!!!
		  
		  
        In order to work, the platform must contain:
        <ul>
        <li>A <a href=#node>Node</a>. This is a regular computer. It allows to configure (stop/start/...) Ethoscopes and fetches their data.</li>
        <li>A <a href=#router>Router</a>. Available commercially. It is required to establish a wireless connection between Node and Ethoscopes.</li>
        <li><a href=#ethoscope>Ethoscopes</a>. These are custom made devices. They acquire video, analyse behaviour in real time and store results.</li>
        </ul>
        The real power of the ethoscopes resides in being able to 3d print <a href=#arenas>customised arenas</a>.
        In addition real time analysis will allow users to interact with animals according to their behaviour, which can be achieved thanks to optional <a href='#ethoscope_mods'>modules</a>.

          The Ethoscope devices are the most important part of the platform. Indeed, they are customisable standalone tracking devices.
          One solution to get Ethoscopes is to contract <a href="http://polygonaltree.co.uk/">polygonal tree</a>, our commercial partner.
          It is also perfectly feasible to 3d print/build your own by following the <a href="https://github.com/PolygonalTree/ethoscope_hardware/tree/master/core">online hardware documentation</a>.

      <h3 id='arenas'>Arenas</h3>
      <p>
          Ethoscopes can fit a variety of 3d printed arenas.
          Examples are available on the <a href="https://github.com/PolygonalTree/ethoscope_hardware/tree/master/arenas">hardware repository</a>.
          Their are also blank templates that can be derived in order to generate novel arenas.
