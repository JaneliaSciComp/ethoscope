<h2>Ethoscope Hardware</h2>
<p>
  This page explains what type of hardware is needed to set-up a minimal working platform.

</p>
<div class="row">
  <h3 id='overview'>Overview</h3>
  <p>

      A FIGURE HERE!!!


    In order to work, the platform must contain:
    <ul>
    <li>A <a href=#node>Node</a>. This is a regular computer. It allows to configure (stop/start/...) Ethoscopes and fetches their data.</li>
    <li>A <a href=#router>Router</a>. Available commercially. It is required to establish a wireless connection between Node and Ethoscopes.</li>
    <li><a href=#ethoscope>Ethoscopes</a>. These are custom made devices. They acquire video, analyse behaviour in real time and store results.</li>
    </ul>
    The real power of the Ethoscopes resides in being able to 3d print <a href=#arenas>customised arenas</a>.
    In addition real time analysis will allow users to interact with animals according to their behaviour, which can be achieved thanks to optional <a href='#ethoscope_mods'>modules</a>.
  </p>

<div class="row">
  <h3 id='node'>Node</h3>
  <p>
        The node should be a standard desktop computer.
        It should be able to run fine with:
  </p>
    <ul>
        <li>4GB of RAM</li>
        <li>An intel i3 processor</li>
        <li>A wireless PCI card</li>
        <li>An ethernet connection</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
    If you can, ensure the hardware supports Linux.
    </p>

<div class="row">
  <h3 id='router'>Router</h3>
  <p>
       On the hardware side, the router can simply be purchased.
       We managed to connect up to 30 devices with a TP-LINK router.

  <h3 id='ethoscope'>Ethoscope</h3>
  <p>
      The Ethoscope devices are the most important part of the platform. Indeed, they are customisable standalone tracking devices.
      One solution to get Ethoscopes is to contract <a href="http://polygonaltree.co.uk/">polygonal tree</a>, our commercial partner.
      It is also perfectly feasible to 3d print/build your own by following the <a href="https://github.com/PolygonalTree/ethoscope_hardware/tree/master/core">online hardware documentation</a>.
  </p>
</div>

<div class="row">
  <h3 id='arenas'>Arenas</h3>
  <p>
      Ethoscopes can fit a variety of 3d printed arenas.
      Examples are available on the <a href="https://github.com/PolygonalTree/ethoscope_hardware/tree/master/arenas">hardware repository</a>.
      Their are also blank templates that can be derived in order to generate novel arenas.

<div class="row">
  <h3 id='ethoscope_mods'>Ethoscope Modules</h3>
  <p>
      Modules are optional hardware extensions that can be used along with Ethoscopes.
      In general, they allow dynamic interaction between animals and hardware.
      For instance, we have developed a hardware module that can turn spin individual tubes in which fruit flies live.
      Mainstream modules should be documented on the <a href="https://github.com/PolygonalTree/ethoscope_hardware/tree/master/modules">hardware repository</a>.
