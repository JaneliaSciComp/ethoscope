    <h2>The Ethoscope Platform</h2>
	<h2>WEBSITE UNDER CONSTRUCTION, be patient ;)</h2>
    <p>
    
    The <i>Ethoscope Platform</i> is a collection of interconnected tools allowing biologists to design experiments,
    acquire and analyse large amount of behavioural data.

	It features :
  <ul>
	  <li> A completely <b>free and open-source</b> set of tools -- software was built on top of `GNU/Linux` and `python`. Ethoscopes are build from *raspberry pis* along with custom *3d printed* parts.</li>
	  <li> <b>Real time video tracking</b> -- this allows experimenters to individually deliver stimulus according to the behaviour of the animals.</li>
	  <li> A modern <b>web-interface</b> to control multiple devices effectively.</li>
	  <li> High-throughput detailed post-hock analysis -- thanks to the <b>R package</b> <a href='https://github.com/gilestrolab/rethomics'>rethomics</a>.</li>
	  <li> A <b>modular design</b> -- it is straightforward to modify both devices and software and create new experimental paradigms. </li>
	  <li> A <b>high scalability</b> -- multiple, inexpensive, ethoscopes can run in parallel within the same platform</li>
  </ul>

  The aim of this website is to describe the platform, explain how it can be set-up and develop a community of users.
