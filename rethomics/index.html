    State of the art behavioural analysis can generate large amount of data.
    For instance, assume a simple experiment running 10 Ethoscopes for 1 week.
    In normal condition, we have two measurements a second (thins includes things like position and shape of the animal) on 20 animals.
    This results in a total of 10 * 20 * 2 * 3600 * 24 * 7  = which is actually <b>1/4 of a billion reads</b>!
</p>
<p>
    Whilst this is a large amount of data to deal with for graphical user interface based tool like Excel, this is a manageable job for statistical languages such as <a href=https://www.r-project.org/>R</a>.
    In order to facilitate data analysis, we have developed an R package named <b>rethomics</b>.
    It can be used for:
</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Loading data from the Ethoscope platform.</li>
        <li>Visualising behavioural trends.</li>
        <li>Analysing quiescence/sleep behaviour.</li>
        <li>Analysing survival.</li>
    </ul>
<p>
    Rethomics has its own exhaustive documentation, and its <a href='http://gilestrolab.github.io/rethomics/'>own website</a>.
