    <h2>Rethomics</h2>
    <p>
	    State of the art behavioural analysis can generate large amount of data.
        For instance, assume a simple experiment running 10 Ethoscopes for 1 week.
        In normal condition, we have two measurements a second (thins includes things like position and shape of the animal) on 20 animals.
        This results in a total of 10 * 20 * 2 * 3600 * 24 * 7  = which is actually <b>1/4 of a billion reads</b>!
    </p>
    <p>
	    Whilst this is a large amount of data to deal with for graphical user interface based tool like Excel, this is a manageable job for statistical languages such as <a href=https://www.r-project.org/>R</a>.
        In order to facilitate data analysis, we have developed an R package named <b>rethomics</b>.
        It can be used for:
        <ul>
            <li>Loading data from the Ethoscope platform</li>.
            <li>Visualising behavioural trends</li>.
            <li>Analysing quiescence/sleep behaviour</li>.
            <li>Analysing survival</li>.
        </ul>
        Rethomics has its own exhaustive documentation, and its <a href='http://gilestrolab.github.io/rethomics/'>own website</a>.
